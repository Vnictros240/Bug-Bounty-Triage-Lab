## 🧭 Overview

This repository demonstrates how a Security Engineer leads, structures, and communicates within a **Bug Bounty Program** and **Vulnerability Triage workflow**.

It simulates the daily operations of a triage analyst:  
- Reviewing and validating vulnerability reports  
- Communicating with researchers and developers  
- Prioritizing fixes  
- Providing leadership with executive-ready summaries  

The project blends **technical accuracy**, **automation**, and **human communication**, reflecting real-world coordination between Blue Teams, developers, and bug bounty researchers.
